Role of soil moisture-temperature feedback on the rise of compound dry hot extremes in the United States

This is repositroy for the scripts used to calculate and analyze compound dry and hot extremes in the US. 
We have used ERA5 monthly dataset (1940-2022) in the study. An empirical approach was used to estimate compound extremes.
Additionally, we have also calculated Soil Moisture-Temperature Coupling over the US following Miralles et al., 2012.
